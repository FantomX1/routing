##Introduction

Fracture\Routing is a simple rougin library, that is made to be easily compatible with other libs.

the user's input in and abstracted representation of request, as long as it implements the required interface.


##Instalation

You can do it by rnning following command:

```sh
composer require fracture/routing:dev-master
